# Car Shop Management System

## Project Overview
The Car Shop Management System is a Windows Forms application designed to streamline the management of a car dealership. This system enables users to browse available cars, filter by categories, and manage their favorite selections. Administrators have full control over users, car listings, and categories, ensuring efficient operation of the system.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system with role-based access control (Admin & User).
- **Car Catalog**: Users can explore available cars, filter by category, and add cars to their favorites.
- **Admin Panel**: Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing users, cars, and categories.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their personal information while maintaining role-based restrictions.
- **Password Security**: Ensures users verify their old password before making updates.
- **Structured Navigation**: Well-organized form transitions for improved user experience.

## Technology Stack
- **C#** – WinForms
- **ADO.NET** – SQL Server for database management
- **Windows Forms (WinForms)** – UI design and user interaction

## Architecture
The application follows a three-layer architecture:
1. **Data Access Layer (DAL)** – Manages database interactions.
2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL)** – Implements application rules and processes.
3. **Presentation Layer (UI)** – Provides the graphical interface for users.

## Learning Outcomes
This project enhanced proficiency in database connectivity, user authentication, role management, and CRUD operations. It also reinforced best practices in software development, including structured code organization and maintainability.
